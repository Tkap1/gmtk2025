IDEA 4
	maybe enemies get faster (so it's harder)
	special enemy that we want to let in the circle because it doesn't take a life. it instead gives bonus gold or something
	do we mess with the circle/loop size? idk


main menu sounds too loud. are we playing them many tiems??
	or is our volume on load not being used? probably not

UPGRADES?
	tower kind of thing that shoots enemies?

give enemies a speed boost at the beginning so we dont have to wait too long for the action to start
should dash be upgrade?
killing an enemy should speed up enemy spawns? so we can go faster
enemy scaling

button tooltip
button hotkey
option to turn off damage numbers
buy x10 and x100

add cooldown on miss attack
PARTICLESSSS
health bars?
enemies with different movement pattern

power up drops?????

more keys for the different actions

ending is dogshit, we need some pause or something


OPTIONS:
	hover over upgrade pause

fix volumes
