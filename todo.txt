IDEA 4
	maybe enemies get faster (so it's harder)
	special enemy that we want to let in the circle because it doesn't take a life. it instead gives bonus gold or something
	do we mess with the circle/loop size? idk


main menu sounds too loud. are we playing them many tiems??
	or is our volume on load not being used? probably not

UPGRADES?
	very long range tower kind of thing that shoots enemies?

should dash be upgrade?

button hotkey

PARTICLESSSS
health bars?
enemies with different movement pattern

more keys for the different actions

ending is dogshit, we need some pause or something
higher enemy spawn rate


OPTIONS:
	hover over upgrade pause
	turn off damage numbers
	turn off gold numbers
	show timer
	lights

MAYBE:
	better leaderboard display

MAYBE:
	power up drops?????
	game stutter when hitting? like 0.1s or something?

SOUND:
	defeat sound
	win sound
	fix volumes
	sound on lose lfie

POLISH:
	some kind of movement animation on player
	make fire particles move away from the player?
	trees? just stuff around so the map is not as empty?
	dont display "paused" text unless we are in default state1
	better highlighting of enemies that will be hit
	shake + different sound when dash hit?
	dash particles?
	enemy wobble

more enemies
