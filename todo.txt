IDEA 4
	maybe enemies get faster (so it's harder)
	special enemy that we want to let in the circle because it doesn't take a life. it instead gives bonus gold or something
	do we mess with the circle/loop size? idk

UPGRADES?
	very long range tower kind of thing that shoots enemies?

OPTIONS:
	hover over upgrade pause
	turn off damage numbers
	turn off gold numbers
	show timer
	lights

POLISH:
	some kind of movement animation on player
	dont display "paused" text unless we are in default state1
	enemy wobble
	tell people to go full screen

mention shift+ctrl
mention ctrl+r
