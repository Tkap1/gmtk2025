IDEA 4
	maybe enemies get faster (so it's harder)
	special enemy that we want to let in the circle because it doesn't take a life. it instead gives bonus gold or something
	do we mess with the circle/loop size? idk


main menu sounds too loud. are we playing them many tiems??
	or is our volume on load not being used? probably not

UPGRADES?
	very long range tower kind of thing that shoots enemies?

should dash be upgrade?

button hotkey

PARTICLESSSS
health bars?
enemies with different movement pattern

more keys for the different actions

ending is dogshit, we need some pause or something
higher enemy spawn rate


OPTIONS:
	hover over upgrade pause
	turn off damage numbers
	turn off gold numbers
	show timer

MAYBE:
	better leaderboard display

UNLIKELY:
	power up drops?????

fix volumes
shake + different sound when dash hit?
better highlighting of enemies that will be hit
dont display "paused" text unless we are in default state1
explain attack and dash
trees? just stuff around so the map is not as empty?
make fire particles move away from the player?
when we lose a life, do some kind of effect
