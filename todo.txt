IDEA 4
	maybe enemies get faster (so it's harder)
	special enemy that we want to let in the circle because it doesn't take a life. it instead gives bonus gold or something
	do we mess with the circle/loop size? idk

UPGRADES?
	very long range tower kind of thing that shoots enemies?

OPTIONS:
	hover over upgrade pause
	turn off damage numbers
	turn off gold numbers
	show timer
	lights

MAYBE:
	power up drops?????
	game stutter when hitting? like 0.1s or something?
	better leaderboard display

SOUND:
	defeat sound
	win sound
	fix volumes

POLISH:
	some kind of movement animation on player
	make fire particles move away from the player?
	trees? just stuff around so the map is not as empty?
	dont display "paused" text unless we are in default state1
	dash particles?
	enemy wobble
	ending is dogshit, we need some pause or something
	tell people to go full screen
	O for options?

more enemies
